## But why?

My `Cat Mate C300 Automatic 3 Meal Feeder` eletronics died after few months of use. Instead of creating more waste I tried to use one of ESP32-C3's laying around to restore the functionality of this automatic feeder. I have use some spare parts and voil√†! It works again and my cat is very happy about it.
